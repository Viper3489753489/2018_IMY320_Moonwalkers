				Fluff that up. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world.

				I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. This is an example of what you can do with just a few things, a little imagination and a happy dream in your heart. Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. I'm going to mix up a little color. We’ll use Van Dyke Brown, Permanent Red, and a little bit of Prussian Blue. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good.

				Just use the old one inch brush. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. You need to have a very firm paint to do this. Brown is such a nice color.

				If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. We need dark in order to show light. I'm gonna add just a tiny little amount of Prussian Blue. You can do it. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping.

				Let your imagination be your guide. This is the way you take out your flustrations. I thought today we would do a happy little picture.

				Very easy to work these to death. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here.

				Nothing wrong with washing your brush. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way.
